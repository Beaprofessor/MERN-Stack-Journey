    <!-- <h1>CSS Flexbox</h1>
    <p>CSS flexbox is a game-changing layout feature that makes it simple to create flexible and adaptive designs. Say
        goodbye to cumbersome CSS hacks and media queries, and hello to Flexbox, which allows you to align and
        distribute things in any direction, adjust their size and spacing, and adapt your layouts to every device. It's
        the modern web developer and UX designer's secret weapon, and it's here to make your life easier.</p>

    <h3>Why do we need a CSS flexbox?</h3>
    <p>
        Navigation: In navigation, we mostly need items to be displayed horizontally. This was hard to achieve before
        flexbox.

        Split navigation: If we want to align some navigation boxes to the right and some to the left then we need to
        use flexbox. It makes it much easier.

        Center item: Before flexbox, it was harder to center an item. Now, with the use of flexbox, it’s a piece of
        cake.

        Pushing footer down in card layout: If you use a card in a CSS grid, you can only control the alignments of the
        card in the grid and not the items inside the card like the card content or its footer. But by using flexbox,
        you can control all the parts.

        Media objects: You can make your page responsive very conveniently using flexbox for all the different devices.

    <h3>Flexbox Elements</h3>
    <p>As discussed above, there are two types of elements: container - the parent element, and items - the child
        element.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Container</h3>
    <p>The Flexbox container includes several attributes for controlling the arrangement and placement of Flex items, including flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, align-content, and flex-wrap. These characteristics enables us to organize Flex objects vertically or horizontally, center them along the main or cross-axis, and regulate their spacing and wrapping.

        Shown below is a flex container with three items:
