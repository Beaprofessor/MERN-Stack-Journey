    <h1>CSS Media Query</h1>
    <h3>
        What are CSS Media Queries
    </h3>
    <p>
        CSS media queries are a CSS feature that allows our web content to adapt to different devices based on screen
        size, device capabilities, and the user's preferences.

        Media queries help to make a modern responsive design with ease. We can use them to create different styles for
        different devices. It aids in the responsiveness of the website.

    <h3>Different Media Types</h3>

    <h3>Structure of a Media Query</h3>

    <code>@media media-type and (media feature) {}</code>

    <h3>Logical Operators</h3>
    <p>
        The<strong> and </strong>Operator :
        As we have seen earlier, we can use the ‘and’ operator between a media type and media feature. The keyword used
        for this operator is ‘and.’ We can also connect multiple media.
        <br>
        Example
        <br>
        <code>@media (min-width: 480px) and (max-width: 700px) {
            /*...*/
           }</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong> or </strong> Operator :
        The or operator is represented by a comma (,) or by or keyword. The ‘,’ is an old notation, whereas the ‘or’
        keyword is a recent notation.

        <br>

        Example :
        <br>

        <code>
            /* new notation */
            @media (min-width: 400px) or (orientation: landscape) {
            }
            <br>
            /* old notation */
            @media (min-width: 400px), (orientation: landscape) {
            }
        </code>


    <p>
        The <strong> not </strong> Operator :
        The not operator is used to negate a media query. The keyword used for this operator is ‘not’. While using a
        not-operator, we must set a media type like print or screen; otherwise, it will become ‘not all’. Hence, it will
        not be applied in any media type.

        <br>

        Example :
        <br>

        <code>
            @media not print {
            /*...*/
           }
            </code>
    </p>

    <h3>Nesting of media queries</h3>
    <p>We can nest one media query with other media queries as well. Nesting of media queries becomes helpful when we
        want to write multiple conditions together. We can use and operator to convert several media queries into one
        media query.</p>
    <code>@media (min-width: 400px) and (max-width: 800px) {
        /*...*/
      }
       /*The above code can also be written as*/
      @media (min-width: 400px) {
       @media (max-width: 800px) {
         /*...*/
       }
      }</code>


    <h3>Using Min and Max</h3>
    <p>In this article, we have seen so many times that various media features have been prefixed with min or max to
        represent minimum or maximum conditions, respectively.

        In the example below, the body's background is green when the viewport width is wider than 20em and narrower
        than 40em. If the viewport width does not match the condition, then it will be red.</p>
    <code>
            body {
                background-color: red;
               }
               
               @media (min-width: 20em) and (max-width: 40em) {
                body {
                  background-color: green;
                }
               }
        </code>
