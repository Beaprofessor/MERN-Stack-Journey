    <!-- 
    Border Declaration in CSS
    An HTML element's border can be set using the border attribute in CSS. When setting the border property, the
    shorthand notation or independent properties can define the border's components separately.

    Border: solid 4px red; 

    Border-Style in CSS
    The border-style property in CSS is used to describe the border style of an element. An element's top, right,
    bottom, and left borders can be styled using the border-style property, which accepts a value or a list of values.

    The border-style property can be used with the following typical values:

    None: No boundary is visible.
    Solid: A line is shown that is solid.
    Dotted: A string of dots is seen.
    Dashed: There are several visible dashes.
    Double: There is a double line.
    Groove: A 3D border with grooves is visible.
    Ridge: A 3D border with ridges is visible.
    Inset: The border is shown with a 3D inset.
    Outset: A 3D outset boundary is seen.
