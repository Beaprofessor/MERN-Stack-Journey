    <h3>What is ::placeholder in CSS</h3>
    <p>
        A CSS pseudo-element is an element added to a selector that allows you to style a specific part of the selected
        element. For example, the ::first-letter can be used to style the first letter of the first line of a paragraph.
        The ::placeholder css is one such CSS pseudo-element used to style the placeholder text.


        The ::placeholder CSS selector creates form components with placeholder text and allows you to style them. The
        placeholder text appears as a transparent or light grey color for most of the popular browsers by default.

        It is used to set a placeholder text, which as a hint, helps the user to know the format of the required input.

        In the above example, the placeholder text helps the user know how the “Full Name” and “Mobile number” need to
        be entered. Let's learn about the syntax and how to program this placeh selector.
