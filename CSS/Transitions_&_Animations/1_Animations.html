    <!-- <h1>Animations</h1>
    <p>Animations are moving objects that make the web page look more attractive. Animation is a property in CSS3 (an
        upgraded version of CSS) used to style the elements that change gradually over time. It has a lot of variations
        that can be customized according to the user's interest. </p>

    <h3>Transition</h3>
    <p>Transitions work as the foundation of animations because they specify the duration of the element changing its
        state smoothly over time. This state change would be abrupt and take effect immediately if there was no
        transition. When using transforms, one should use transitions to create a smooth and gradual animation.</p>
    <p>
        There are mainly four transition methods available in the CSS. Let's check them out.

        <br>
        <strong>transition-property</strong>: Here, you can specify the property of the element where you want to set
        the transition,
        e.g.
        width, height, etc.
        <br>

        <strong>transition-duration</strong>: Here, you can specify the time to complete the transition on the targeted
        property. You can
        give the time in 's' or 'ms', where 's' refers to the second and 'ms' refers to the millisecond. Examples of
        this
        can be '2s' or '200ms'.
        <br>

        <strong>transition-delay</strong>: Here, you can specify the delay in transition, which will take a pause before
        starting the
        transition. You can give the delay time in 's' or 'ms', where 's' refers to the second and 'ms' refers to the
        millisecond. Examples of this can be '3s' or '300ms'.

        <br>
        <strong>transition-timing-function</strong>: Here, you can control the speed of transition. It is linear by
        default, but you can
        change it to many functions like ease, ease-in, ease-out, etc.
    </p>
    <div id="div1"></div>
    <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong>

        In this example, we have used all four transitions, that is, property, duration, delay, and time function.
        Instead of declaring all four methods separately, you can do this in a single line. Let us see the shortcut for
        this.
<br><br>
        <strong>Syntax:</strong>
<br><br>
        transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function] [delay];
        <br><br>

        <strong>Example</strong>:

        transition: border-color 0.8s ease-out 1s;
    </p>
    <br><br> -->
    <!-- <h3>Transform</h3>
    <p>As the name says, transform means changing in shape and size. Similarly, in animation, Transforms allow us to visually manipulate an element by rotating, skewing, scaling or translating.</p> -->


    <ul>
        <!-- <li>
            <h3>Scale()</h3>
            <p>The scale() property impacts the size of the element since it is applied to the font size of the element, padding, width and height. It also serves as a shortcut function for the scaleX and scaleY functions.</p>
            <div class = "item">
                This is an example, we are starting with scale()
                property which is 25px width and height is 25px. But
                since we are using scale property, it will now scale up
                to the element size. The padding, text and margins are
                also affected by this property.
            </div>
        </li> -->

        <!-- <li>
            <h3>Translate</h3>
            <div class="div d1"></div>
            <div class="div d2"></div>
            <p>Explanation :In this example, we took two div in green and blue colour and set a translate() property with 25px on the X axis and 25px on the Y axis. As you can see in the output screen, after hovering the cursor on the div, it moves 25px right and 25px down. You can also move the divs in opposite directions by taking the parameters in negative.
            </p>
        </li> -->
        <!-- <li>
            <h3>rotate()</h3>
            <div class="div"></div>
            <p>Explanation : In the above example, we used the rotate() property to turn the div 360 degrees clockwise. If you want to rotate the div anti-clockwise, you can use the degrees in negative.

        </p>
        </li> -->
        <!-- <li>
            <h3>Skew</h3>
            <div class="item"></div>
            <p>
                Explanation:

                In the above example, we have used the skew() property to describe the tilt of the div in degrees. Here,
                the div is tilting 20 degrees. You can also tilt the div in the opposite direction by giving the degrees
                in negative.
            </p>
        </li> -->
    </ul>
