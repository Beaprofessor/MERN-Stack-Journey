<!-- A start tag <tag name>, a closing tag </tag name>, and the content added between them make up an element in HTML.

Technically, an element is a collection of start tags, attributes, end tags, and content between them. -->

<!-- Syntax -->

<!-- <tag name> Content goes here </tag name> -->


<!-- Nested HTML Elements
    As the name implies, HTML elements can be nested, meaning an element can include additional elements within it. Every HTML document is made up of nested HTML elements. -->
<!-- for Example - > 
 <body>
  <h1>My First Heading</h1> the h1 and p are nested in the body tag..
  <p>My first paragraph</p>
 </body> -->


<!-- There are two types of Elements in HTML:
  
  Block-level Elements and Inline Elements. -->

<!-- Block-level elements -->
<!-- A Block-level element takes up the whole horizontal space of its parent element (container) as well as the vertical space equal to the height of its contents, resulting in the formation of a "block."
  
    Browsers often display the block-level element with a newline before and after it. 
  
    A block-level element always begins on a new line and occupies the entire available width (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). -->


<!-- Below is the list of all Block-level elements in HTML: -->

<!-- <address> ->Contact information.
<article> -> Article content.
<aside> -> Aside content.
<blockquote> -> Long ("block") quotation.
<details> -> Disclosure widget.
<dialog> -> Dialog box.
<dd> -> Describes a term in a description list.
<div> -> Document division.
<dl> -> Description list.
<dt> -> Description list term.
<fieldset> -> Fieldset label.
<figcaption> -> Figure caption.
<figure> -> Groups media content with a caption.
<footer> -> Section or page footer.
<form> -> Input form.
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6> -> Heading levels 1-6.
<header> -> Section or page header.
<hgroup> -> Groups header information.
<hr> -> Horizontal rule (dividing line).
<li> -> List item.
<main> -> Contains the central content unique to this document.
<nav> -> Contains navigation links.
<ol> -> Ordered list.
<p> -> Paragraph.
<pre> -> Preformatted text.
<section> -> Section of a web page.
<table> -> Table.
<ul> -> Unordered list. -->


<!-- Inline elements
    Inline elements simply take up the space defined by the tags that define the element rather than interrupting the flow of the content.

    An inline element does not begin on a new line and only takes up as much space as is required.

    An example of an inline element is an anchor (or link) tag <a></a>. You can put several links in a row, and they will display in a line. -->
<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>
    <p>If we want to use just a single word as an anchor, we wrap just that one <a
            href="https://www.codingninjas.com/">word</a> in anchor tags.</p>
</body>

</html> -->
