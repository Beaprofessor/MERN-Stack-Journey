<!-- Types of attributes in HTML -->

<!-- Boolean Attribute 
   In HTML, a boolean attribute is an attribute with no value. They do not consist of name/value pairs but only of the name. The presence of the attribute itself indicates that the attribute is "true," and the absence of the attribute indicates that the attribute is "false." -->

   <!-- General Purpose Attributes 
    The general purpose attributes are attributes that can be used with any element and are not specific to a particular element or type of element. On the majority of HTML elements, you can utilize attributes such as id, title, class, style, and so on. Letâ€™s discuss them one by one.

    for id ->> <div id="idName">hello</div>
    for class ->> <div class="className">Heyyy</div>
    for style ->> <div style ="width: 100px; height:100px;"></div>
