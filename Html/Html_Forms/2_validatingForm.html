    <h1>Validating form with Parsley.js</h1>

    <h3>What is Parsley.js ?</h3>
    <p>
        Parsley.js is a JavaScript library for form validation. It is used in web applications to ensure the data
        entered in a form is in the correct format. It can be used to set various criteria and ensure the data is
        accurate and meets the requirements set by the developer.

        Parsley.js provides a set of built-in validation rules that can be applied to any input fields like email,
        passwords, checkbox, date, etc. These validation rules are backed by a set of error messages that are used to
        inform the user about any mistakes while filling out the form.

        Let’s discuss all its features in detail.</p>

    <h3>Features of Parsley.js</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Built-in Validation rules</h4>
            <span>Parsley.js contains a large number of predefined rules that can be used for the validation of
                different input fields. These rules ensure the correct format is being followed.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Customized rules:</h4>
            <span>Along with the built-in rules, users are free to create their own rules to specify their requirements.
                This makes it more flexible and convenient for developers.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Easy to implement:</h4>
            <span>Parsley.js can be easily added to any web application without the need for any extra knowledge. The
                CSS and JavaScript files are only needed to be included in the project.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Error messages:</h4>
            <span></span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Let’s dive into a real-world example of Form validation. Follow the below-mentioned steps, and you will end up
        with a Signup form for your website.</h3>

    <h4>Include jQuery and Parsley.js</h4>
    <p>First, you need to include jQuery, as Parsley.js relies on jQuery (>= 1.8). Both jQuery and Parsley.js can be
        included in two ways, either using a CDN link or by downloading the files and including it manually.</p>

        The CDN links can be included as below in the head section.
