<!-- HTML Paragraph
            A paragraph is used if you want to finish what you are talking about and start a new conversation. 

            If you want to explain something on your web you use a paragraph.
 
            For a paragraph we use a <p> tag.
 
            In HTML we have different tags to display the paragraphs, to break them into a single line, and many more. Below are some tags used in paragraphs. Letâ€™s see the implementation of these tags and paragraphs.
